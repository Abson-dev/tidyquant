`tidyquant` integrates the best resources for collecting and analyzing financial data, `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and `PerformanceAnalytics`, with the tidy data infrastructure of the `tidyverse` allowing for seamless interaction between each. You can now perform complete financial analyses in the `tidyverse`. 

## Benefits

* A few core functions with a lot of power
* Integrates the quantitative analysis functionality of `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and `PerformanceAnalytics`
* Designed for modeling and scaling analyses using the the `tidyverse` tools in [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* Implements `ggplot2` functionality for beautiful and meaningful financial visualizations
* User-friendly documentation to get you up to speed quickly!

## One-Stop Shop for Serious Financial Analysis

With `tidyquant` all the benefits add up to one thing: _a one-stop shop for serious financial analysis!_

### Core Functions

* __Getting Financial Data from the web: `tq_get()`__. This is a one-stop shop for getting web-based financial data in a "tidy" data frame format. Get data for daily stock prices (historical), key statistics (real-time), key ratios (historical), financial statements, dividends, splits, economic data from the FRED, FOREX rates from Oanda.  

* __Manipulating Financial Data: `tq_transmute()` and `tq_mutate()`__. Integration for many financial functions from `xts`, `zoo`, `quantmod`,`TTR` and `PerformanceAnalytics` packages. `tq_mutate()` is used to add a column to the data frame, and `tq_transmute()` is used to return a new data frame which is necessary for periodicity changes.  

* __Performance Analysis and Portfolio Analysis: `tq_performance()` and `tq_portfolio()`__. The newest additions to the `tidyquant` family integrate `PerformanceAnalytics` functions. `tq_performance()` converts investment returns into performance metrics. `tq_portfolio()` aggregates a group (or multiple groups) of asset returns into one or more portfolios. 

### Comparing Stock Prices

Visualizing the stock price volatility of four stocks side-by-side is quick and easy...

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README_1_volatility.png")
```


### Evaluating Stock Performance

What about stock performance? Quickly visualize how a $10,000 investment in various stocks would perform.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README_2_returns.png")
```

### Evaluating Portfolio Performance

Ok, stocks are too easy. What about portfolios? With the `PerformanceAnalytics` integration, visualizing blended portfolios are easy too!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ports <- tribble(
    ~Portfolio, ~`Facebook (%)`, ~`Amazon (%)`, ~`Netflix (%)`, ~`Google (%)`,
    1, 50, 25, 25, 0,
    2, 0,  50, 25, 25,
    3, 25, 0,  50, 25,
    4, 25, 25, 0,  50
)

htmlTable::htmlTable(ports, rnames=FALSE, css.cell = "padding-bottom: .25em; padding-top: .25em")
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README_3_port_returns.png")
```

This just scratches the surface of `tidyquant`. Here's how to install to get started.
