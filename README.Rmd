> Bringing financial analysis to the tidyverse

`tidyquant` integrates the best resources for collecting and analyzing financial data, `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and `PerformanceAnalytics`, with the tidy data infrastructure of the `tidyverse` allowing for seamless interaction between each. You can now perform complete financial analyses in the `tidyverse`. 

## Benefits

* __A few core functions with a lot of power__
* __Integrates the quantitative analysis functionality of `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and _now_ `PerformanceAnalytics`__
* __Designed for modeling and scaling analyses using the the `tidyverse` tools in [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)__
* __Implements `ggplot2` functionality for beautiful and meaningful financial visualizations__
* __User-friendly documentation to get you up to speed quickly!__

## One-Stop Shop for Serious Financial Analysis

With `tidyquant` all the benefits add up to one thing: _a one-stop shop for serious financial analysis!_

### Comparing Stock Prices

Visualizing the stock price volatility of four stocks side-by-side is quick and easy...

### Evaluating Stock Performance

What about stock performance? Quickly visualize how a $10,000 investment in various stocks would perform.

### Evaluating Portfolio Performance

Ok, stocks are too easy. What about portfolios? With the `PerformanceAnalytics` integration, visualizing blended portfolios are easy too!

* Portfolio 1: 50% FB, 25% AMZN, 25% NFLX, 0% GOOG
* Portfolio 2: 0% FB, 50% AMZN, 25% NFLX, 25% GOOG
* Portfolio 3: 25% FB, 0% AMZN, 50% NFLX, 25% GOOG
* Portfolio 4: 25% FB, 25% AMZN, 0% NFLX, 50% GOOG
